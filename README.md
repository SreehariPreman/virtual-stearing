# virtual-stearing

In this project i created an opencv implementation of hand gesture controlled virtual stearing for playing games by using image processing and computer vision


controls:-

Forward - Both hands in parallel
Right - rotate towards right
Left - rotate towards left
backward - only one hand infront of the camera
